# Whoop_Data_Analysis

This application takes two sets of data heart rate variability and training stress score, as inputs and returns various statistics and a graph of the two data series over time. Heart rate variability (HRV) is simply the measure of time in milliseconds in between heart beats and is one way to quantify physiological “readiness”. Training stress score (TSS) is a figure that quantifies (in a single number) the physiological load a workout has on your body based on duration and intensity. These sets of data are samples I have taken of myself using various fitness trackers and websites; the data set spans a periods of 108 days.
